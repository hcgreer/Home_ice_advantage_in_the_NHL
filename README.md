# Home_ice_advantage_in_the_NHL

When teams are playing at home there is consistent talk about how having the crowd at their backs played a key role in determining the outcome of the game. This makes perfect sense when there is a key 3rd down for the away team in football and the crowd is doing everything in their power to keep the offense from hearing anything. Same goes for basketball when it just seems like the more into the game the crowd is the less the home team seems to miss. Though when looking at the sport of hockey the fans act much differently. Most noise from the fans comes after a significant event has already occurred, like a goal. Most of the time there are also long wait times between significant events in the game which mellows out the crowd. That brings me to the question, “Does the home team in the NHL have a statistical advantage over the away team?”
